        <h2>Welcome to the experiment!</h2>
        <p>
          In our day to day life, numerous stimuli act upon our sense organs. Yet we notice and attend to very few
          objects or events. Hence, Attention is defined as the act of focusing our consciousness on an object or an
          event.

        <p>
          In this experiment, we will try to understand how much we can grasp in one short presentation with different
          types of stimuli, such as, dots, words, nonsense syllables and numbers
